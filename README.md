# TriviaGame

This is a timed game of trivia questions to test your knowledge.  You will begin by clicking the button the says "Begin".  A new screen will appear and you will have a set amount of time to read through the questions and select the appropriate answer.  If you finish before the time runs out, simply push the "Submit" button, if the time runs out before you finish it will change screens.  Whether you select and answer for each or not those unselected answers will still count as wrong. The comupter will generate the amount of right and wrong answers at the end.

# Programming

There was an array of questions, answers, and answer choices set up as objects.  If, then statements were used to select the correct answer for the appropriate question.  A set interval was used for the timer and put inside a decrement function.  If, then statements were also used to calculate if user choice was correct and tally the score.
